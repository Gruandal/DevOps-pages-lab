# 🧑‍💻 DevOps Pages Lab
> Automated activity tracking and publishing via GitHub Actions + Pages.

---

### 🪄 About This Site
This site is automatically updated by a **GitHub Actions workflow** every day at **09:00 (Taiwan time)**.  
The workflow fetches my recent public GitHub activities and commits them to the repository’s `README.md`,  
which is then rendered here through **GitHub Pages** using the **Cayman Jekyll theme**.

**Purpose:**  
To demonstrate CI/CD integration, automation, and deployment using DevOps principles.
